# OBAT.fr Style Guide for AquaConnect

This document outlines the styling approach used to implement the OBAT.fr design language in the AquaConnect application.

## Color Palette

We've implemented a professional blue-based color palette inspired by OBAT.fr:

- Primary: `#0ea5e9` (blue-500) with variations from `#f0f9ff` to `#0c4a6e`
- Secondary: Professional grays from `#f8fafc` to `#0f172a`
- Accent: Complementary blues and teals
- Status colors: Green for success, amber for warnings, red for errors

## Typography

- Font family: Inter with fallbacks to system fonts
- Headings: Bold with slight negative letter spacing for better readability
- Body text: 1.6 line height for optimal reading experience
